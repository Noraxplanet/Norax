## Planet: Norax
meaning: The name "Norax" can evoke a sense of mystery and adventure, but since it's a fictional name, you can attribute any meaning you like! Here are a few ideas for what "Norax" could symbolize:

1.  **Nostalgia**: The "Nor" prefix can suggest a sense of remembrance or longing for home, fitting for a planet where characters might find themselves far from their origins.
    
2.  **Navigator**: The "rax" ending might imply exploration or navigation, reflecting the journey of players discovering new regions and challenges on the planet.
    
3.  **Nature and Balance**: Combining "nor" (which can suggest "north" or direction) with "ax" (similar to "axis") could symbolize a balance of nature and civilization, hinting at the planet's diverse ecosystems.
    
4.  **Fictional Language**: You could also create a backstory that "Norax" comes from an ancient language of the planet’s original inhabitants, meaning something like “land of mystery” or “place of wonders.”
